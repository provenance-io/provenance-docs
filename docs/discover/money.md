## USDF

_[USDF](https://explorer.provenance.io/asset/usdf.c) is a bank-minted tokenized deposit referencing fiat currency on Provenance Blockchain._

USDF is available through the [USDF Consortium](https://www.usdfconsortium.com/), a membership-based association of 
FDIC-insured banks that have come together to build modern blockchain-based payments rails. USDF enables real-time
payments, multi-party settlement, and digital asset marketplaces.

**USDF is:**
- A digitized representation of an existing fiat deposit, not a new asset
pegged to another or backed by collateral.
- Able to move between KYC/AMLâ€™d accounts at member institutions.
- Programmable, offering member banks the opportunity to employ
smart contacts and thus a wide range of use cases.
- A low cost, real time transaction and settlement mechanism, invisible
to customers via their existing front end interface.
