# Staking Hash

![Staking Hash](/img/discover/Staking_w_Mark.png)

The Provenance Blockchain is a public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, meaning that the weight of validators (someone 
who verifies transactions on the blockchain) is determined by the amount of staking tokens bonded to them as collateral. 
Hash is bonded to a validator by Hash holders delegating Hash to the validator, creating a “staking pool.”

Staking enables Hash holders to earn rewards for helping secure the network. The reward is in the form of additional 
Hash. This additional Hash is automatically earned from the validator, when the validator receives revenue for 
completing tasks on the blockchain. The revenue is split between the validator and their participating delegates. Set 
as a percentage, the validator has the ability to apply a commission on the part of the revenue that goes to the 
delegators. Visit our [FAQs](/docs/pb/faq/delegator-faq.md) for more details on staking.

Two options available for staking Hash are:

- Directly on Provenance. Available to all Hash token-holders, a [step-by-step guide](https://provenance.io/delegate-hash) will walk you through the process 
of using your wallet to directly stake Hash on Provenance Blockchain.

- Anchorage Digital. Anchorage is the institutional banking custodian of Hash holdings, and also provides institutions 
such as venture capital firms, hedge funds, family offices, and others the ability to stake Hash with the added 
benefit of regulated, secure custody. Hash holdings never leave the security of the Anchorage platform. 
Visit [Anchorage](https://www.anchorage.com/get-started/) to speak with one of their representatives.
