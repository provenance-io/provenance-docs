# Community

## Overview

The community is defined as the collective of users, developers, researchers, maintainers, clients, companies, organizations, investors, staked token holders, and delegators. Companies and organizations can create and operate private client apps that leverage the Provenance Blockchain ecosystem services. The integrity of the blockchain network relies on incentivized [Validators](validator.md) and [Delegators](delegator.md) through Hash-utility-token [gas fees](../../blockchain/basics/gas-and-fees.md), and a healthy Hash Investor community. \*\*\*\*
