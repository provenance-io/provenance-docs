# Quick Start: Get a Wallet & Hash

## What is a Wallet?

Everyone who transacts on Provenance Blockchain has their own **[Account](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/basics/accounts.html)** 
on the blockchain. Analogous to a bank account, your blockchain account holds your on-chain assets, like 
[Hash](docs/discover/hash) or [USDF](https://www.usdfconsortium.com/).

You are the only entity that has access to your account. Your account is secured using a cryptographic key pair. 
You don't necessarily need to know anything about cryptography to use Provenance Blockchain, but you need to keep the Private Key 
portion of your key pair safe, and a special app called a **[Wallet](/docs/discover/wallets)** does that for you.

:::info A Wallet app helps you use a blockchain in three ways:

1. Helps you set up your account, and keeps your private key safe and secure.
2. Shows you what assets your hold in your account.
3. Allows you to perform actions with your account, like transferring funds or signing (approving) blockchain transactions.

For developers building software on Provenance Blockchain, you'll need to consider your strategy for key management.

## What is Hash?

Hash is the [utility token of Provenance Blockchain](/docs/discover/hash). As a utility token, Hash helps keep 
Provenance Blockchain secure through its Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. You can participate in securing the 
network by purchasing Hash and staking it by delegating your Hash to one of the Validators.

Hash is also used to pay fees for transacting on the blockchain. All operations on Provenance Blockchain, from minting 
an NFT to sending a payment incur a small fee paid for in Hash. The fees are collected and distributed to the 
Validators as a reward for securing the network.

Holding Hash also gives you the right to participating in the Governance process for Provenance Blockchain. 
You have one vote for every Hash token you have staked.


## I'm in, how do I get set up?

### Step 1: [Select which Wallet](/docs/discover/wallets) you'll use
### Step 2: Purchase Hash from [OKCoin](https://go.okcoin.com/hash) or [dlob.io](https://provenance.io/purchase-hash)
### Step 3: If interested, learn how to [stake your Hash](/docs/discover/staking)


:::tip
For developers needing Hash on `testnet`, you can get Hash from the [Faucet](https://explorer.test.provenance.io/faucet)
