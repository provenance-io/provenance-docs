# Quick Start: Write a Smart Contract

Intro?

Smart Contracts on Provenance Blockchain are written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and are executed using the
[ProvWasm](https://github.com/provenance-io/provwasm) smart contracting platform. ProvWasm is an extension of the
[CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) environment, including adaptations for the [Provenance Modules]()
