# Quick Start: Become a Validator

Provenance Blockchain is a public Proof-Of-Stake blockchain
and relies on a set of [**Validators**](/docs/pb/ecosystem/community/validator) to secure the network. Validator nodes perform the critical function of proposing 
and validating transactions on the Provenance Blockchain network. A strong network of validators ensures
Provenance Blockchain security is maintained. 

Validators stake [**Hash**](/docs/discover/hash) to become part of the active network and share in 
[**rewards**](/docs/pb/ecosystem/financial-services-blockchain/distribution) produced by the network's fee distribution framework.

:::info Benefits of becoming a Validator

- Earn Hash through fees paid by participants in the network
- Earn additional commission when other Hash holders delegate their Hash to your node
- Vote on governance proposals for the Provenance Ecosystem

### Get started

1. Read through the [benefits and responsibilities](/docs/pb/ecosystem/community/validator) of being a Validator
and the [Validator FAQ](/docs/pb/faq/validator-faq)
2. Learn how to [run a node](/docs/pb/blockchain/running-a-node/running-a-node-1/)
3. Setup the recommended [node architecture](/docs/pb/blockchain/running-a-node/running-a-node-1/become-a-validator)
4. [Purchase Hash](https://provenance.io/purchase-hash) to stake and join the [mainnet](https://github.com/provenance-io/mainnet)
