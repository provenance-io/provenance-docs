# Transfer USDC from Axelar to Provenance using Osmosis

Any token or asset in the Cosmos ecosystem can be transferred between Cosmos-based blockchains through IBC (the 
Inter-Blockchain protocol), provided that a relayer is running to transport messages between any two chains.

The [Osmosis DEX](https://app.osmosis.zone/) (Decentralized EXchange), running on top of the [Osmosis blockchain](https://osmosis.zone/), acts as a source of liquidity and 
interchange for many cryptocurrencies. 

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to transfer the stablecoin [**USDC**](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc) from the [Axelar Network](https://axelar.network/) to Provenance
using the Osmosis DEX and the [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/). 

Axelar is currently the only provider of USDC on 
Osmosis (as of November 2022), and the version of USDC available is an Axelar-wrapped token called `AXLUSDC`. However, 
Axelar and Circle have announced that within the next few months, a native, non-wrapped version of USDC will be available
on Osmosis.

## The Token Flow

For the convenience of this guide, we're going to transfer some Provenance HASH to Osmosis and swap it for USDC. 
Alternatively, one could purchase USDC on public exchanges, such as Coinbase or Binance, and then transfer them to Osmosis.

Once we have USDC, we will also need some OSMO coin (the native token for the Osmosis blockchain) to be able to pay for 
the gas fee for the IBC transfer from Osmosis to Provenance.

## 1. Set Up a Keplr Wallet

Keplr is a non-custodial (you hold your own keys) blockchain wallet that works well with Osmosis and other Cosmos-based blockchains.

For this exercise, the Chrome Extension version of the Keplr Wallet is most convenient.

1. Install and open the [Keplr Wallet Chrome Extension](https://www.keplr.app/)

2. Do not create a new account. Instead, choose to `Import existing account` so that you can use the Keplr wallet with your existing Provenance account

3. Make sure to switch the seed input from the default `12 words` to `24 words` to match your Provenance Blockchain
mnemonic length

## 2. Connect Keplr to Provenance Blockchain

Next, we need to connect your Keplr Wallet to the Provenance Blockchain. This YouTube video describes two
alternative methods for connecting your Keplr Wallet to Provenance using either:
- [Restake](https://restake.app/) or
- [Osmosis Frontier Zone](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/)

:::tip Verify it worked:

Once you have your Keplr Wallet connected to Provenance, verify that your Provenance account address shown in the Keplr Wallet is correct, and that your Provenance tokens are available as expected.

## 3. Transfer Hash to Osmosis

We're now going to transfer some Hash from the Provenance Blockchain to the Osmosis Blockchain over IBC. Go to the [Osmosis Frontier Zone](https://frontier.osmosis.zone)
and click on `Assets` on the left side of the screen.Frontier

Use the Asset Search form to find HASH on Provenance Blockchain, then click on `Deposit`

Connect your Keplr wallet, then choose how much Hash you wish to transfer.

## 4. Swap Hash for USDC

Now that your Hash is sitting on the Osmosis blockchain, you can use the Osmosis DEX to swap Hash for USDC. Click on
`Swap` on the left-hand side menu of the Osmosis Frontier Zone.

In the Swap form, choose HASH/Provenance for the first coin and USDC/Axelar for the second.

</center>

Approve the swap, and now you have USDC!

## 5. Swap Hash for OSMO

The IBC transfer of USDC from the Osmosis chain to the Provenance chain incurs a gas fee that must be paid in OSMO, so
repeat step 4, this time swapping some Hash for OSMO token.OSMO
