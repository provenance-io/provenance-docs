# Purpose-Built for Financial Services

## What it means to be purpose-built for financial services

Section 1

## Supports the full lifecycle of tokenized real-world financial assets

Provenance Blockchain originated in 2018, and is a decentralized public blockchain built in the Cosmos ecosystem, with Cosmos SDKs. The architecture of the blockchain was designed intentionally to meet the specific and unique requirements of the financial services industry.

Specific capabilities are engineered directly into the protocol to enable digital assets and privacy, and each of these specific capabilities are underpinned by unique features, modules and APIs.

### Issuance

Asset issuers require the ability to ensure compliance with complex rules. At the protocol-layer, create a digital asset and enact a set of protocol-enforced governing rules, such as limiting asset transactions to accounts with certain attestations.

- [Sanction / Quarantine Module](https://developer.provenance.io/docs/sdk/quarantine/)
- [Name / Attribute Module](https://developer.provenance.io/docs/sdk/attribute/)

### Confidentiality

Many participants require their information, positions, and trades to remain confidential. Provenance Blockchain features a data asset management system that includes data access permissioning, secure storage, and controls.

- [Prov WASM](https://developer.provenance.io/docs/sdk/metadata/)
- [Encrypted Object Store](https://developer.provenance.io/docs/pb/p8e/overview/encrypted-object-store/)

### Identity

Financial relationships and transactions require a known identity. Provenance Blockchain enables the ability to record, reference, and manage attributes critical to financial service decisioning, governance, and compliance directly in the protocol-layer.

- Self Custody Accounts
- Group & Institution Level Controls
- Account Attestation
- Fine-grained Authorization

### Interoperability

Move digital assets, as well as tools and services, in and out of Zones and the Mainnet, and in and out of the Provenance Blockchain Network.

### Settlement

Asset owners seek instant, secure and frictionless transactions. Provenance Blockchain features deterministic finality and protocol-embedded capabilities that protect participants from the risk of default of their counterparties.

- [Hold Module](https://developer.provenance.io/docs/sdk/hold/)
- [Exchange Module](https://developer.provenance.io/docs/sdk/exchange/)

### Zones

Provenance Blockchain is a network of zones, with a decentralized public mainnet, and permissioned zones that are interoperable with the mainnet. Zones support use cases that desire or require permissioned infrastructure.
