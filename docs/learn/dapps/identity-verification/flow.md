# Verification Flow

Here's the process by which a user obtains and uses identity verification on Provenance Blockchain

## User Undergoes KYC

The user is usually directed to a identity provider from an application. 

To start the process, the user must go to an identity verification provider company. 

The identity verification process typically involves the user providing some personal information, such as their name,
date of birth, and address, as well as submitting relevant documentation to prove their identity. The documentation
required may vary depending on the level of verification required by the application or service. For example, some
services may require a government-issued ID, while others may require additional documents such as proof of address or
proof of income.

Once the user has completed the verification process, the provider will write an attribute to the user's account on the
Provenance Blockchain indicating that the user has passed the verification requirements. This attribute serves as proof
that the user has completed the process and can be used to grant access to specific features or services within the
Provenance ecosystem.

In addition, the identity verification provider will store the verification data in the EOS, which is a decentralized
database that is maintained by a network of computers. By storing the verification data in the EOS, the provider ensures
that the data is secure and cannot be tampered with. Furthermore, the provider will also create a unique NFT (
non-fungible token) that represents the verification data on the chain. This NFT allows the user to own their
verification data as an asset in their account or wallet, ensuring the security and privacy of their sensitive
information.

Overall, the identity verification process is an important step in ensuring the security and integrity of the Provenance
Blockchain ecosystem. By requiring users to complete this process, Provenance is able to maintain a high level of trust
and security, which is critical in any blockchain-based application or service.
