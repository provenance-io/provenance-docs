The term “minting” in the blockchain space refers to the initial recording of an asset on a blockchain.

Blockchain-native assets are minted directly on the blockchain and have no existence beyond the construct of the chain.

Other, pre-existing assets may be “onboarded” to the blockchain by minting a new asset record (NFT or Marker) as the authoritative registration of the asset’s existence and ownership.

Provenance Blockchain is agnostic to whether an asset is newly issued on chain or has been migrated to the blockchain for registration. Either case results in newly-minted asset records on-chain.
