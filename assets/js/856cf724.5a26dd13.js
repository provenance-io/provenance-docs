The overriding goal of the Processing Context is to keep the time the data spends in this area as short as possible and to destroy all keys to access the data as soon as reasonable. In order to limit the scope of the processing context the first step is to only include the minimum number Smart Contract public keys required to successfully endorse a transaction. This means that in many cases only 3 to 5 total smart contract instances out of potentially dozens spread across the Provenance Blockchain Network will be selected for access to the information. During the smart contract execution output blocks are generated using a process that removes any DEKs assigned to the processing Context to eliminate any long term persistent smart contract access to the data. The last two areas to focus on for reducing access are the DEKs passed into the smart contract in the parameters and the handling of the symmetric payload encryption key. Frequent rotation of encryption keys by the smart contract reduces the time window when a DEK can be retrieved as old keys are permanently deleted. The symmetric encryption key is the last and most sensitive piece of information because it provides permanent access to the resource (as outlined in the submission and Retrieval contexts as an alternate access scheme).
